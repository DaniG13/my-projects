# My Projects
## Research Projects
* **Chiral Nanomaterials (ongoing)**  
The aim of this project is to analyse and synthesise chiral nanoparticles for circular polarised light detection. The current task is exploring the seed-mediated sythesis pathway for chiral gold nanoparticles. Summary of literature review is included in   
## Other Projects
* **Summer of Science: Nanomaterials**  
A summer long literature review of the thermodynamics, kinetics, surface effects and quantum effects at the nanoscale. Also includes spectroscopic characterisation techniques and a study on the applications of graphene. Final Report: 
## Course Projects
* **Seminar: Shape Memory Effect in Nitinol (ongoing)**  
A literature survey on the phase transformations and thermomechanical properties of Ni-Ti Shape memory alloys. Midterm Report: 
* **Zn-S-O Predominance Diagram**  
Plotting the Zn-S-O predominance diagram (using matplotlib library) for the process of roasting of sphalerite in the extraction of Zn. Code: Report: 


* **Machine Design Analysis**  
Selected an everyday object, created CAD model in Solidworks, static structural analysis in Ansys and performed a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. Solidoworks CAD: Ansys: Final Report:
