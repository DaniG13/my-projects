# My Projects
## Research Projects
* **Chiral Nanomaterials (ongoing)**  
The aim of this project is to analyse, design, simulate and synthesise chiral nanoparticles for circular polarised light detection. The current task is exploring the seed-mediated sythesis pathway for chiral gold nanoparticles. Summary of literature review is included [here](https://github.com/DaniG13/my-projects/blob/main/Chiral%20Nanomaterials_Literature.pdf)
## Other Projects
* **Summer of Science: Nanomaterials**  
A summer long literature review of the thermodynamics, kinetics, surface effects and quantum effects at the nanoscale. Also includes spectroscopic characterisation techniques and a study on the applications of graphene. [Final Report](https://github.com/DaniG13/my-projects/blob/main/Nanomaterials_Report.pdf)
## Course Projects
* **Seminar: Shape Memory Effect in Nitinol (ongoing)**  
A literature survey on the phase transformations and thermomechanical properties of Ni-Ti Shape memory alloys. [Midterm Report](https://github.com/DaniG13/my-projects/blob/main/Shape_Memory_Midterm.pdf)
* **Zn-S-O Predominance Diagram**  
Plotting the Zn-S-O predominance diagram (using matplotlib library) for the process of roasting of sphalerite in the extraction of Zn. [Code](https://github.com/DaniG13/my-projects/blob/main/Predominance_Code.py) [Report](https://github.com/DaniG13/my-projects/blob/main/Predominance_Report.pdf)


* **Machine Design Analysis**  
Selected an everyday object, created CAD model in Solidworks, static structural analysis in Ansys and performed a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis.

* **Transient Heat Transfer**  
Coded a FDM simulation of the convectional cooling of a steel rod in Matlab with appropriate boundary conditions [Code](https://github.com/DaniG13/my-projects/blob/main/Transient%20Heat%20Transfer.m)
